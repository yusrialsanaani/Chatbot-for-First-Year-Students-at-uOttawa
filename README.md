# Chatbot-for-First-Year-Students-at-uOttawa

The chatbot aims to solve issues first year students will have while trying to get accustomed to the university. 
We implemented this chatbot by providing uOttawa website as an external web page hence the different user interface. 
Costume payloader have been used to include clickable links and rich texts. 
Naturally dialogflow chatbot although allows for integration with popular channels, does not have a flow in a conversation hence there is limitation in error avoidance.

**The competency questions used in this chatbot:**

- Q1: How can I get to know my university?
- Q2: Where can I find solutions for academic issues?
- Q3: How to get information related to jobs and job searches?
- Q4: How to get information regarding scholarships and fees?
- Q5: How do I secure my rights and safety at the university?Â 
- Q6: How does the university's health insurance scheme work?
